Hello! Welcome to my Uber Ride Fare Prediction project.

In this project, I will be using machine learning to create a regression model that will the price of a uber ride based on parameters such as 
pick up time, the pick up and drop off location, datetime, and passenger count. I will be using the XGBoost to build the regression model.
I obtained this dataset on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/uber-fares-dataset)


I will be using Python with the XGboost framework and the following libraries: Pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and seaborn.
